description: Comprehensive visualization of AI workflows, API request flows, system architecture, and model training in OpenCV SyncX.

## Overview

Diagrams are essential for **understanding, planning, and optimizing AI-powered image processing workflows** in **OpenCV SyncX**. This documentation includes **detailed flowcharts, API workflow diagrams, dataset pipelines, AI model selection trees, and real-world AI deployments**.

All diagrams are built using **Mermaid.js**, making them interactive and reusable.

## **1️⃣ AI Image Processing Workflow**

The **AI processing pipeline** in OpenCV SyncX follows a structured workflow from **data input** to **model inference** and **final output**.

<Mermaid
  chart={`graph TD;
    Upload[Upload Image/Video] --> |Preprocessing| Preprocessing[AI Preprocessing Engine];
    Preprocessing --> |Feature Extraction| ModelExecution[AI Model Execution];
    ModelExecution --> |Detection/Enhancement| PostProcessing[Post-processing];
    PostProcessing --> |Final Output| Output[Processed Image/Video];
  `}
/>

```jsx
<Mermaid
  chart={\`
    graph TD;
    Upload[Upload Image/Video] --> |Preprocessing| Preprocessing[AI Preprocessing Engine];
    Preprocessing --> |Feature Extraction| ModelExecution[AI Model Execution];
    ModelExecution --> |Detection/Enhancement| PostProcessing[Post-processing];
    PostProcessing --> |Final Output| Output[Processed Image/Video];
  \`}
/>
```

## Decision Tree

Decision trees illustrate choices and possible outcomes, making them ideal for decision-making workflows or processes involving multiple paths.

<Mermaid
  chart={\`
    graph TD;
    Client[Client (User or Application)] --> |Sends Request| API[OpenCV SyncX API];
    API --> |Validates & Prepares Data| PreProcessing[Preprocessing Engine];
    PreProcessing --> |Runs AI Model| AIModel[Deep Learning Model];
    AIModel --> |Post-processing & Output| Response[Processed Image + JSON Data];
  \`}
/>

```jsx
<Mermaid
  chart={\`
    graph TD;
    Start[Select AI Task] --> Choice{What do you need?};
    Choice -->|Object Detection| OD[Use YOLO, Faster R-CNN];
    Choice -->|Image Enhancement| IE[Use Super-Resolution, Denoising Models];
    Choice -->|Face Recognition| FR[Use FaceNet, DeepFace];
    Choice -->|Pose Estimation| PE[Use OpenPose, MediaPipe];
    Choice -->|Action Recognition| AR[Use LSTM, Transformer Models];
    OD --> End[Deploy Model];
    IE --> End;
    FR --> End;
    PE --> End;
    AR --> End;
  \`}
/>

```

## Entity-Relationship Diagram

Entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs) are used to model relationships between entities in a system. They are widely used in database design and system architecture planning.

<Mermaid
  chart={`erDiagram
    CUSTOMER ||--o{ ORDER : places
    ORDER ||--|{ LINE-ITEM : contains
    PRODUCT ||--o{ LINE-ITEM : "included in"
    CUSTOMER {
        string name
        string email
    }
    ORDER {
        int orderNumber
        date orderDate
    }
    LINE-ITEM {
        int quantity
        float price
    }
    PRODUCT {
        int productId
        string name
        float price
    }`}
/>

```jsx
<Mermaid
  chart={\`
    erDiagram
    CUSTOMER ||--o{ ORDER : places
    ORDER ||--|{ LINE-ITEM : contains
    PRODUCT ||--o{ LINE-ITEM : "included in"
    CUSTOMER {
        string name
        string email
    }
    ORDER {
        int orderNumber
        date orderDate
    }
    LINE-ITEM {
        int quantity
        float price
    }
    PRODUCT {
        int productId
        string name
        float price
    }
  \`}
/>
```

Each of these diagrams serves a specific purpose and Mermaid makes it easy to generate them dynamically. Feel free to experiment with the provided code snippets and adapt them to your needs.
