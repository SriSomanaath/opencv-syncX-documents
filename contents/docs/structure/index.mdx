## OpenCV SyncX Structure

OpenCV SyncX is built on a modular architecture that enables seamless AI-driven image and video processing. Its structure includes core components such as:

- **Deep Learning Models**: Pre-trained and custom AI models for various vision tasks.
- **API Layer**: RESTful API endpoints for integrating with external applications.
- **Processing Pipeline**: Automated workflows for image classification, object detection, and segmentation.
- **Edge & Cloud Compatibility**: Deploy models on cloud servers or edge devices efficiently.

## Features Overview

- [x] **AI-driven object detection and segmentation** â€“ Automatically detect and classify objects in images.
- [x] **Image enhancement using deep learning** â€“ Apply noise reduction, super-resolution, and color correction.
- [x] **Automated workflows for real-time processing** â€“ Streamline processing for large-scale applications.
- [ ] **Additional model integrations (Upcoming)** â€“ Future updates will include pose estimation and action recognition.
