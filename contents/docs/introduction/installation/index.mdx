To install and set up OpenCV SyncX, ensure that you meet the necessary prerequisites. This guide will walk you through the process of getting started with OpenCV SyncX.

## Prerequisites

<Step>
<StepItem title="System Requirements">

- **Python 3.8+**: OpenCV SyncX requires Python 3.8 or later.
- **CUDA 11+ (For GPU Acceleration)**: Required for GPU-powered deep learning tasks.
- **Docker (Optional for containerized deployments)**.
- **Git**: Ensure Git is installed for cloning the repository.

To verify installation, run:

```bash
python --version
git --version
```

</StepItem>
<StepItem title="Code Editor">
Youâ€™ll need a code editor to work on the project. Recommended options include:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
- Any other text editor of your choice.`

</StepItem>
<StepItem title="Required Knowledge">
- **OpenCV**: Basic understanding of OpenCV and computer vision concepts.
- **Deep Learning Frameworks**: Familiarity with TensorFlow or PyTorch (optional but recommended).
- **REST API**: Understanding API requests for model interaction.

</StepItem>
</Step>

## Installation

<Step>
<StepItem title="Clone the Repository">
First, clone the OpenCV SyncX repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/opencv/syncx.git
```

Change the directory to the project folder:

```bash
cd syncx
```

</StepItem>
<StepItem title="Install Dependencies">
Use pip to install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install dependencies such as:

- OpenCV
- NumPy
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (for AI models)
- Flask (for API services)

</StepItem>

<StepItem title="Running the Development Server">
Start the OpenCV SyncX server by running:

```bash
python syncx_server.py
```

This will start the local server, and you can access the dashboard at:

```bash
http://localhost:5000
```

</StepItem>

<StepItem title="Editing the Project">
  - **Model Configuration:** Modify AI models in `models/`.
  - **API Endpoints:** Adjust API logic in `api/`.
  - **Configuration Files:** Update settings in `config.json`.

To make any changes, open the files in your editor and modify them as needed.

<Note title="Required" type="danger">
  Ensure that dependencies are installed before running the server to avoid errors.
</Note>

</StepItem>
<StepItem title="Building for Production">
Once you are ready for production, run:

```bash
python build.py
```

This will optimize the system for deployment.

</StepItem>
<StepItem title="Running Production Server">
To run the production server:

```bash
python syncx_server.py --mode production
```

The production application will be available at:

```bash
http://localhost:5000
```

</StepItem>
</Step>

## Optional

<Step>
<StepItem title="Deploying with Docker">
For a containerized setup, build and run the Docker container:

```bash
docker build -t opencv-syncx .
docker run -p 5000:5000 opencv-syncx
```

</StepItem>
<StepItem title="Linting and Pre-commit Hooks">
The project uses Black for code formatting and pre-commit hooks. Customize them in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.
</StepItem>
</Step>

## Important Information

For GPU acceleration, ensure that **CUDA and cuDNN** are correctly installed and configured in your environment.
